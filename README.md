# Slogger

Slogger is a multi-purpose keylogger written
in python. It has many features such as stealing
saved WiFi and browser passwords.

The keylogger can act as both a remote and local
logger. The local logger creates a log file in
the current directory and is switched on by
default.

The remote functionality needs to be turned on
manually. It will send logs to the mail server 
specified in regular time intervals(default=10 sec).

Usage is specified in the script itself. Although
it is reccomended to turn off Windows defender
before running the script.

Cheers!!
